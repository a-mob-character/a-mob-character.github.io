<h2>
    Step 1: Prepare the links
</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Upload the images and their thumbnails to the external service of your choice and get the URLs of both.
        <div><em>IMPORTANT!: Make sure you get the link to the actual image file and not a web page.</em></div>
    </li>
    <li>
        Make two lists in plain text, one for the thumbnail URLs, the other for the URLs of the original images. Each URL should be on a new line. Do not separate the URLs by any punctuation (like comma, full-stop) 
        <div><em>IMPORTANT!: the URLs of the thumnails and original images should be in the same order</em></div>
    </li>
</ol>
